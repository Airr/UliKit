UKSPEECHSYNTHESIZER
-------------------

A wrapper class around the Carbon SpeechChannel that tries to be compatible with but also
expands upon the features of Apple's NSSpeechChannel.

Also included is UKSpeechSettingsView, which provides a simple user interface for modifying
the settings of a speech channel.

requires that you clearly mark them as having been modified by you, while
maintaining the original markings and copyrights. I don't like getting bug
reports about code I wasn't involved in.

I'd also appreciate if you gave credit in your app's about screen or a similar
place. A simple "Thanks to M. Uli Kusterer" is quite sufficient.
Also, I rarely turn down any postcards, gifts, complementary copies of
applications etc.


REVISION HISTORY:
0.1 - Initial release.
0.2 - Fixed a bug where the speech channel could accidentally dispose of itself. Fixed a bug in gender reporting of the speech settings view.
